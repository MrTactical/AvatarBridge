# Where this could go next

Written the day 4.0.2 shipped. Nothing here is promised, and the standing rule still
outranks all of it: a bug somebody hits while wearing an avatar comes first. Most of what
follows exists because a real failure pointed at it.

## YAPS 5: the plug follows a path, not a point

Today `yaps_resolve.cginc` holds exactly one socket — one position, one forward, one
engagement, chosen as the single best candidate. Give it an **ordered list of sockets with
arc-length ranges** and three of the four things on the wishlist fall out of one change:

| want | how it falls out |
|---|---|
| a ring mid-shaft *and* a hole at the tip | two entries in the list |
| portal: in at one socket, out of another | two entries with a gap between their ranges |
| duplicate: the shaft showing in two places | the same range mapped twice |

A vertex shader cannot create geometry, so a "duplicate" is the existing shaft drawn at two
frames rather than a second shaft. It costs nothing and it cannot be two different lengths.

**Multiple plugs per socket is a separate, much smaller job.** The bending already works:
every plug resolves sockets in its own shader, so two plugs into one socket needs no change
at all. What breaks is the socket's *shapes* — a ChilloutVR trigger writes from whichever
sender touched it last, so two plugs fight over the depth instead of the deepest winning.
Socket-side, no extra sync, and it can ship on its own.

**What the platform gives and charges for.** Unity hands a mesh four vertex-light slots and a
socket takes two, so the light path carries exactly two sockets for free — a portal pair is
two sockets, so the headline case can cost nothing. The contact channel is where bits get
expensive: eight values per socket, 96–288 bits per plug by tier, doubled by a second socket.
Give socket two its own lower tier (engagement and position, orientation dropped first).

Socket depth stays one synced parameter per socket. That is deliberate: sharing a slot
between sockets assumes one is engaged at a time, which is exactly the assumption
multi-socket and portal exist to break.

**Order to build it in:** deepest-plug-wins first (small, self-contained), then the socket
list with socket two on lights, then portal and duplicate as ranges on top, then the
converter repointing an author's reactions onto YAPS's own depth — last, because it deletes
VRCFury's solver and their setups vary wildly.

## The converter: prove it before the instance does

Everything here comes from the same observation: the expensive bugs are the ones nobody can
see in the editor, and every one this month was found by a person wearing the avatar.

**A remote twin.** The strongest idea on this page. Spawn a second copy of the converted
avatar beside the first, driven *only* by parameters that actually sync, and let the tester
walk between them. Every wearer-only bug becomes visible in the editor: the socket shapes
that moved for nobody, the toggle that never left the wearer's machine, the smoothing rig
that froze at its defaults. The Animator Tester already snaps `#` locals to their defaults
for its Remote view; this is that idea given a body.

**A conversion diff.** The regression harness writes a digest per avatar and compares runs.
Users get the same tool: convert, change a setting, convert again, and read what moved.
"Reconverting on a new release" stops being an act of faith.

**A toggle sweep, shipped.** `Dev/Corpus/ToggleSweep.cs` flips every menu toggle on and off
and reports anything that did not come back. It found real bugs. It should be a button in
the Toolkit rather than a thing only the harness runs.

**A budget planner.** The sync tally exists in the report; make it interactive. Tick the
features you want, watch the bits, and let it name the cheapest thing to drop. Most avatars
that go over do it by accident, in a menu they never counted.

**An upload preflight.** One list, run before uploading: our diagnostics, the CCK's own
validators, the texture flags, parameters past the cap, missing metas. Everything that
currently fails at the last moment, in an order that says which to fix first.

**Advanced Tagging, inferred.** Content tags are currently listed as "not converted, set
them yourself". An avatar carrying YAPS knows what it is. Offer the tags rather than
assuming them, and nobody uploads an NSFW avatar untagged by accident.

**Incremental reconversion.** Whole-avatar every time today. Keyed on source hashes, the
passes whose inputs did not change could be skipped. Worth it only once the corpus can prove
a skipped pass and a run pass produce the same output.

## The animator merger: make the invisible visible

Ten thousand lines, the most fragile thing in the package, and the place where a bug is
hardest to see because nothing throws — the avatar simply behaves slightly wrongly.

**A conflict map.** Which layers write the same binding, in what order, at what weight, and
who wins. Half the toggle failures this project has fixed are two layers writing one
property and nobody knowing. It would also have caught the strength bug on sight: a layer at
weight 0.2 writing a blendshape *no other layer writes* creeps to full, because the value it
blends from is its own last frame. That is a rule a map can check.

**A weight audit.** Flag every partial-weight layer whose properties nothing else writes.
That single check is worth writing on its own.

**State-machine reachability.** States nothing can enter, transitions whose conditions can
never be true, parameters read but never written. The pieces exist across the diagnostics;
gathering them into one pass would name a class of bug that currently only shows up as "the
toggle does nothing".

**Explain a parameter.** Pick one and get its whole life: where it came from, what renamed
it, whether it syncs and why, which layers read it, which clips write it. Debugging today
means reading three report sections and inferring the join.

**Deterministic ordering, stated.** Layer order decides who wins. The merger has rules for
it; they should be visible in the report, so a surprising result can be traced to a rule
rather than to luck.

## Two constraints worth remembering before designing anything

**ChilloutVR runs an avatar's triggers on the wearer's machine alone.** Anything
contact-driven that the room must see has to be a synced parameter. This is not VRChat's
model and it invalidates the instinct to make contact parameters local because they are
"free everywhere".

**An animator-driven parameter can never sync.** `IsReadOnly` is true for anything
controlled by a curve, and `IsSynced` requires `!IsReadOnly`. Any design that computes a
value in the animator and expects the room to see it is already wrong; sync the inputs, or
compute it on every client from something that does sync.
